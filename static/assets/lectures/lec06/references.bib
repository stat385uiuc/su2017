Abstract = {The field of personal relationships is examined in terms of the developmental processes of differentiation and integration. A need for greater integration is noted, leading to discussion of several issues likely to facilitate development of the field. These include greater attention to describing phenomena studied, properties of relationships, applied research and the role of time in understanding personal relationships. The fish-scale model of omniscience in interdisciplinary research is offered as one means of achieving integration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
